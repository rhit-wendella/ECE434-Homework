# HW06
## Blinking an LED
- Got the led to blink. Could not see the LED physically blink when I set the delay to 0. The pin was toggling at 12.5 Mhz. There was a bit of jittering and some overshoot, but it was stable.

## PWM
- I got the PWM working. When I hooked it up to the oscilliscope, it was toggling at 50 Mhz max when I set the delay low. I could notice the standard deviation, but it was small. The thing was that it wasn't jittery and was stable. That was interesting to see.
