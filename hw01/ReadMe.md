# HW01: Etch-a-sketch
This is homework 1 which is creating an etch-a-sketch

My code creates an etch-a-sketch in the terminal which you can move and draw on.

You specify at the beginning how wide and how long you want the grid to be.
Then you specify what direction you want to go:
"U" is to move up
"D" is to move down
"L" is to move left
"R" is to move right
"Q" is to quit the program

Happy Sketching!
